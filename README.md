# E_Cargo

E-Cargo is a project that it enables cargo carriers to find loads uploaded by cargo owners on E-Cargo Android App. It also gives same opportunity to cargo owners. Through E-Cargo Application, cargo owners can find the best drivers on the routes they identify. E-Cargo can be thought as cargo version of Uber or BlaBlaCar.

You can find the some code parts of E-Cargo Project. I cannot share all parts of the project because of privacy.
